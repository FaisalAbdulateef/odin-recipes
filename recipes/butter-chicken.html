    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter chicken is a dish originating from India. The chicken is mixed with spiced tomato and butter. The sauce<br>
       is very rich and flavorful in texture which is also why this dish is very famous.</p>

    <p>The dish originated in New Delhi in the 1950s. The curry was made by chance when leftover chicken was<br>
        mixed with tomato gravy.<br><br></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup crushed buttery round cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, cut into pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).<br><br></li>
        <li>Place cracker crumbs and eggs into 2 separate shallow bowls. Mix cracker crumbs with garlic salt<br>
            and pepper.<br><br></li>
        <li>Dip chicken in eggs, then dredge in crumb mixture to coat. Arrange coated chicken in a 9x13-inch<br>
            baking dish. Scatter butter around chicken.<br><br></li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about<br>
            40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F.<br><br></li>
