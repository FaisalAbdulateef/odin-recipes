    <h1>Dolma</h1>
    <img src="dolma.jpg" alt="Dolma">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dolma is a group of "stuffed" dishes that is associated with the Ottoman cuisine and countries
        such as Iraq, Iran, <br>Syria, Jordan, Turkey, and Egypt that were in the Ottoman empire.</p>

    <p>Dolma dishes are made by wrapping cabbage and other leaves around the filling, and by stuffing the filling
        inside <br>vegetables such as tomatoes. The filling can consist of rice, chicken, beans, and chopped
        onions.<br><br></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 onions, minced</li>
        <li>1 Â½ cups uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried currants</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pine nuts</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried mint</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried dill weed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) jar grape leaves, drained and rinsed</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Saute onions until tender. Stir in rice and hot water to
            cover.<br>
            Cover and simmer until rice is half cooked, about 10 minutes.<br><br></li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in tomato paste, currants, pine nuts, cinnamon, mint leaves, dill weed, allspice
            and cumin.<br>
            Let mixture cool.<br><br></li>
        <li>Prepare a large pot by placing an inverted plate on the bottom; this protects the dolmas from direct heat
            when steaming.<br><br></li>
        <li>Rinse grape leaves in warm water; drain and cut off any stems. Place about 1 teaspoon of the cooled rice
            mixture in the<br>
            center of a leaf. Fold in the sides and then roll into a cigar shape. Place in prepared pot. Repeat with
            remaining ingredients.<br><br></li>
        <li>Pour in just enough warm water to reach the bottom of the first layer of dolmas. Cover and simmer over low
            heat for<br>
            30 to 45 minutes, or until rice is totally cooked. Check the water level often and add more as
            necessary.<br><br></li>
    </ol>
